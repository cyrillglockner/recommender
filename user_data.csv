Our passion is to help people save money and save the planet at the same time. 

The problem we are solving is that solar is way more expensive, confusing & risky than what people thought...so rather than making a change, they do nothing. Add to this the current uncertain economic times, and its clear the existing financing options just don't work for a lot of people. 

What we do is buy rooftop solar installations for our customers and charge them 1 flat fee that is lower than their average electricity bill. They get immediate savings and don't have to worry about ROI or long term financial burdens imposed by loans or leases.

5547683,Malcolm,Startup,UnitedKingdom,London,,"Some 50 years ago, a schooner yacht called Marauder visited St. Helena Island and my dad and his good friend Bert took the crew out fishing to catch yellowfin tuna.

On board the yacht they had a small antiquated canning machine and pressure cooker, and the crew taught my dad and his friend Bert how to can tuna. Between the two of them they found enough money, and they ordered their own canning machine and pressure cooker - and they started to experiment.

Eventually they stumbled upon a recipe that suited their pallet and a small family artisanal-cannery was born. 

My dad died a few years later and his friend Bert became my 'Papa' Bert. 

In 2021, at the ripe old age of 90, Bert became ill, so I went off to St. Helena to see him… One sunny December lunchtime whilst we were sat on his veranda eating our tuna mayo sandwich (Liberty Tuna – a south African brand, produced in Thailand), he turned to me and said “why doesn’t canned tuna taste like it used to when me and your dad made it” … It was a moment of huge emotion for us both and without giving it a second thought I said “don’t worry Papa, one day we’ll have our own canned tuna again” to which he said “why can’t you do it” and again, without a thought I said “OK papa I will” … he said “I would like that”.

By utilizing multi-spectral satellite imaging with the power of our proprietary Artificial Intelligence analytics we can generate transparent NFT contracts with the farmers and post the whole transaction on blockchain, with our technology platform we create a decentralized, trusted system of certification that opens all projects up to public audit through total transparency and traceability; eliminating the need for 3 rd party certifiers and further reducing the cost of offset production. And due to this advanced and cost efficient technology Spiro Carbon can pay farmers cash incentives to help them transition to more eco-friendly low methane emission farming practices, with as much as 80% of the total carbon offset value paid to the farmer directly which is almost 3X more than legacy carbon offset programs, and these carbon offset payments can be an 18% increase in farmer incomes helping the quality of life for their families.

I grew up outside of Memphis, was educated in New England and lived most my adult life on the West Coast: 35 years San Francisco and 7 years in rural Western WA.  During those years, I got uncomfortably close to the ravages of significant  climate change in the Bay Area and the acceleration of such in WA.  

My professional life was dedicated to imbuing ethics and artistry into the floral gift giving world. I wrote 2 books/guides on floral gift giving and with the release of the 2nd edition simultaneously started a web based wire service  with 5 channels launched ion 1997.  That was great fun being privy to glamour & intrigue serving clients such as David Letterman, Al Gore, JZ, Elton, Oprah, Ellen...the list goes on. I sold it in 2020.  

I graduated with a BS in Botany but my deep love resides with designing and maintaining productive ecosystems that  supports diverse wildlife.  To me, a garden without wildlife is a 'silent' one, to echo Rachel Carson.  

My daughter lives in Brooklyn. so what better life balance between family affinity and professional goals to move Morningside Heights (NYC) amidst 3 fabulous Parks where I live with my Standard Poodle.

Ghana has more than enough potential using renewable energy sources to provide power and sustainable solutions to the environment.I started the company with the vision of revolutionizing a major transition of the country’s energy sector into renewables to provide green energy.Using solar energy, providing solar panels to residential buildings and industries, my focus is also about human development, hence concentrating on the rural parts of the country where many local communities have never had access to power, providing them basic schools, hospital /clinics and local factories as well as solar powered water purification systems and solar water pumps for those in deprived areas with no potable water or electricity access.My second project was to provide sustainable waste management solutions by converting waste into biofuels using pyrolysis process, where we could refine/upgrade the biofuels to be used in heavy machinery as well as converting waste into green hydrogen and lastly using and trapping methane gas, and other green houses gases at landfills to produce electricity.These are sustainable solution projects that I have dedicated myself to accomplishing.While the Western world advances and few African countries like South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia and Kenya take the lead into a sustainable future I am committed to making sure my company plays a significant role in doing so for Ghana, to improve on the life of citizens.I recently gained admission to study Master in Business Administration and Management and Park University in the United States, with the vision of adding more knowledge, skills to increase entrepreneurial vision and future I seek.I believe with the right international platform, I will be able to seek possible partnerships, collaborations or investments.I believe the future of the world starts from today and producing clean energy using renewable sources, we can increase industrialization and economic development.",,"Find customers or partners,Find funding",Energy Generation and Storage,"Recycling and Waste Management,Fuels / eFuels",,,
